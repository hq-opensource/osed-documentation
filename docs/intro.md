# Introduction to the POCTES platform

In the dynamic landscape of modern energy systems, the demand for innovative solutions that seamlessly integrate with existing infrastructure while providing adaptability, scalability, and interoperability is ever-increasing. Recognizing this imperative, we embarked on the journey to develop the Proof of Concept of Transactive Energy System (POCTES).

POCTES stands as a testament to our commitment to revolutionizing the energy sector by offering a modular, open-source platform designed to empower electric utilities, laboratories, and universities worldwide. At its core, POCTES embodies the ethos of flexibility, collaboration, and advancement, making it a pioneering force in the realm of transactive energy systems.

The rationale behind the creation of POCTES was simple yet profound: we sought to address the evolving needs of electric utilities by providing them with a modular system that could be tailored to their specific requirements. By embracing a highly modular system, we enable utilities to integrate grid functions that align with their unique challenges and objectives.

Grid functions are precisely tailored to allow utilities to manage the flexible assets behind the meter of their customers and respond to forecasted or real-time grid demands. Whether it's shifting or curtailing energy consumption, or harnessing the power of electric vehicles, batteries, or renewable energy generators, grid functions are designed to bolster grid stability and efficiency in the operations of the distribution system. The modular approach and the construction of custom grid functions provide utilities with the flexibility to optimize their operational challenges, ensuring that POCTES can meet the evolving needs of electric utilities today and in the future.

Central to the ethos of POCTES is its open-source nature. By adopting an open-source approach, we facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among utilities, universities, and laboratories worldwide. Moreover, POCTES leverages several well-known open-source projects, such as Home Assistant and EdgeX, Docker, and Kubernetes, to facilitate fast deployment and development. Written mainly in Python and Golang and utilizing Docker and Kubernetes, POCTES is a cloud and hardware-agnostic platform. Every architectural decision taken by POCTES was made with the aim of making it easier to use by third parties. When a utility, laboratory, or university develops a new grid function, it becomes available to any other party using the platform. Thus, the efforts made by any party multiply the benefits for the entire society.

In essence, POCTES heralds a new era in the realm of transactive energy systems and utility grid functions, offering electric utilities a pathway to unlock the untapped potential of customer assets and navigate the complexities of modern grid management with confidence. Join us on this transformative journey as we redefine the future of energy together with POCTES.
