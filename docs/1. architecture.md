# Architecture

The OSED platform is composed of multiple services and modules that live in the cloud or the EDGE. The services that operate on the cloud communicate with the services that operate in the EDGE using securized protocols. Moreover, OSED uses [Astarte](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/) to register, manage and securely communicate with the EDGE devices. The following figure shows the relationships between the multiple components and the following sections of this documentation will explain in detail each of the components.
