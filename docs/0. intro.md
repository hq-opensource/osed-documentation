# The OSED platform

In the dynamic landscape of modern energy systems, the demand for innovative solutions that seamlessly integrate with existing infrastructure while providing adaptability, scalability, and interoperability is ever-increasing. Recognizing this imperative, we embarked on the journey to develop the Open Source EDGE DERMS (OSED), where DERMS stands for Distributed Energy Resources Management System.

OSED stands as a testament to our commitment to revolutionizing the energy sector by offering a modular, open-source platform designed to empower electric utilities, laboratories, and universities worldwide. At its core, OSED embodies the ethos of flexibility, collaboration, and advancement, making it a pioneering force in the realm of transactive energy systems.

The rationale behind the creation of OSED was simple yet profound: we sought to address the evolving needs of electric utilities by providing them with a modular system that could be tailored to their specific requirements. By embracing a highly modular system, we enable utilities to integrate transactive energy and grid functions that align with their unique challenges and objectives.

Grid functions are precisely tailored to allow utilities to manage the flexible assets behind the meter of their customers and respond to forecasted or real-time grid demands. Whether it's shifting or curtailing energy consumption, or harnessing the power of electric vehicles, batteries, or renewable energy generators, grid functions are designed to bolster grid stability and efficiency in the operations of the distribution system. The modular approach and the construction of custom grid functions provide utilities with the flexibility to optimize their operational challenges, ensuring that OSED can meet the evolving needs of electric utilities today and in the future.

Central to the ethos of OSED is its open-source nature. By adopting an open-source approach, we facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among utilities, universities, and laboratories worldwide. Moreover, OSED leverages several well-known open-source projects, such as Home Assistant and EdgeX, Docker, and Kubernetes, to facilitate fast deployment and development. Written mainly in Python and Golang and utilizing Docker and Kubernetes, OSED is a cloud and hardware-agnostic platform. Every architectural decision taken by OSED was made with the aim of making it easier to use by third parties. When a utility, laboratory, or university develops a new grid function, it becomes available to any other party using the platform. Thus, the efforts made by any party multiply the benefits for the entire society.

In essence, OSED heralds a new era in the realm of transactive energy systems and utility grid functions, offering electric utilities a pathway to unlock the untapped potential of customer assets and navigate the complexities of modern grid management with confidence. Join us on this transformative journey as we redefine the future of energy together with OSED.

# The OSED proposition 

OSED offers a composable EDGE DERMS that can be tailored according to the needs of the utility. This is achieved by adding only the grid functions that are required by the utility. Moreover, the high modularity of the system allows for the creation and destruction of EDGE coordinators, or the deployment of only the grid functions that are required by each specific electric area. The OSED's approach of pushing the communication complexity to the EDGE allows it to be inserted between the DERMS and the client, between the aggregator and the client, or between a virtual power plant and the client, as illustrated in the following figure:

This documentation will describe how OSED simplifies the management of assets behind the meter for power utilities. 


# OSED Future development roadmap 

OSED (Open-Source EDGE DERMS) aims to make buildings responsive to the grid's needs by integrating smart devices and user assets within buildings. The platform optimizes their use to mitigate grid demands such as demand response, renewable energy curtailment, congestion, and outages. Leveraging edge and cloud computing, machine learning, AI, natural language processing, and optimization, OSED allows users to provide energy flexibility to the grid whenever necessary. The project emphasizes interoperability, cloud and hardware independence, and open-source development to maximize reach and adaptability.
