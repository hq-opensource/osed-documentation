Currently, the DAC grid function supports three tariff types: flat, time-of-use, and shift consumption.

The shift consumption tariff encourages load shifting by offering low prices during specific periods and high prices during others. These incentives prompt building intelligence systems to adjust their consumption patterns accordingly.
